+Andreas Gohr / Chris Smith - Dokuwiki
There is a fair degree of collaboration / exchange of ideas and code
beteen Dokuwiki's UTF-8 library;
http://dev.splitbrain.org/view/darcs/dokuwiki/inc/utf8.php
and phputf8. Although Dokuwiki is released under GPL, its UTF-8
library is released under LGPL, hence no conflict with phputf8

+Henri Sivonen (http://hsivonen.iki.fi/php-utf8/ /
http://hsivonen.iki.fi/php-utf8/) has also given permission for his
code to be released under the terms of the LGPL. He ported a Unicode / UTF-8
converter from the Mozilla codebase to PHP, which is re-used in phputf8
