Installation, http://manual.tangocms.org/installation
========================

	1) To install TangoCMS you will need to upload/move all files and folders to a directory in your web/document root, (eg - public_html).
		-> Installation to a sub-directory is perfectly fine!

	2) Go to the 'install' directory, eg: http://example.com/install/

	3) Follow the simple steps to installing TangoCMS.

	4) Once installed, remove the installation directory (/install).

	5) To get to the AdminCP (Control Panel) you will need to go to /admin, for example: http://example.org/admin
		-> If you are using the 'standard' router (no SEF URLs) you will need to go to /index.php?url=admin


Troubleshooting, http://manual.tangocms.org/troubleshooting
========================

	1) I can't get passed the first Checks that TangoCMS makes
		* If the checks fail at the Extensions then you will have to make sure that you have all needed extensions installed for PHP.

		* When the checks fail for Directories, it means that those directories are not writeable, the correct permissions and ownership for directories should be:
			owner: The user the script is running as
			group: The group the script is running as
			permission/chmod: 0775

			You can do this on any Unix/Linux/BSD operating system with 2 simple commands. Replace 'USER' and 'GROUP' with the correct user and group respectively:
			chown -R USER:GROUP /path/to/needed/directory
			chmod -R 0775 /path/to/needed/directory

		* If it fails for files, this again means you don't have the correct permissions setup so that they are writeable, the permissions should be for the files:
			owner: The user the script is running as
			group: The group the script is running as
			permission/chmod: 0664

			You can do this on any Unix/Linux/BSD operating system with 2 simple commands. Replace 'USER' and 'GROUP' with the correct user and group respectively:
			chown -R USER:GROUP /path/to/needed/directory
			chmod -R 0664 /path/to/needed/directory
